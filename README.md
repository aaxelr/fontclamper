# Font Clamper

A tool to calculate font sizes that scale linearly using css clamp.
[Font Clamper is live here](https://fontclamper.vercel.app/).

Read Pedro Rodriguez' article ['Linearly Scale font-size with CSS clamp() Based on the Viewport' on CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/linearly-scale-font-size-with-css-clamp-based-on-the-viewport/) to learn more.

## Tech
Font Clamper is built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

I would normally use [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) but for a simple tool like this I felt that a full-fledged app framework would be a bit overkill. _In hind-sight it would have been nice to use SvelteKit if only for the smoooooth setup of linting and testing..._
